
  SmartMenus 6 - How to update from older versions
====================================================

    To update from older SmartMenus 6 versions, you just need to replace your
    script core file "c_smartmenus.js" with the updated one. Your configuration
    file "c_config.js" (without any changes) should be completely compatible
    with every future v6.x release.

    If there are any changes to the configuration file "c_config.js" in the new
    version you are updating to (like the addition of new variables that control
    new features), they will be explicitly mentioned in the changelog file
    "changelog.txt" for the versions that have been released between your
    current version and the one your are updating to. But note that you will not
    need to change your config file in any way to make your menus function as
    before with the updated script core. You may just need to make the changes
    to take advantage of any new features.

    If you use core CSS (you should know what this is if you are updating and
    you are using it - if you don't know, however, please take a look at the
    manual "manual.html"), you will also need to regenerate it with your config
    file and the new script core as any future version may include some small
    changes to the CSS code used by the script.
